## Notes About the Dataset
The dataset I used for this project can be found on the Kaggle website.

Here is a link to the original dataset:

It is important to note that while a lot can be discovered from this dataset, it does have its limitations.  The main limitation is that it only contains information on two demographics: Mexican Illegal Immigrants and All Illegal Immigrants.  It doesn't give us information about any other countries.

It should also be mentioned that the numbers listed are only the illegal immigrants that were ARRESTED.  This means that there were almost certainly more illegal immigrants each year that managed to enter the country unnoticed.  As such I cannot claim that my analysis is an accurate representation of trends in illegal immigration overall; it only extends to illegal immigrants that were arrested.
